# AI-Powered Resume Evaluator

This project is an AI-powered Resume Evaluator that analyzes how well a resume aligns with a given job description. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP), semantic embeddings, and dynamic keyword extraction, it simulates the behavior of modern ATS platforms to deliver a comprehensive match score. The system helps both job seekers and recruiters assess fit with precision, beyond simple keyword matching.
